# 3D Printed Rocket

This is project to store data models a 3d printed rocket required, and related rocket engineering programs.

## Background

There are around 3 millions parts for the Saturn V rocket. It may take years to make and assemble a traditional rocket. Why there are so many parts for a traditional rocket? This is because traditinal manufacturing may struggle a lot to produce and assemble intricate parts, the common way to produce a intricate part is splitting it into tons of simple pieces, engraving piece by piece through CNC machine tools, and then assemble them togather. We need a modern and efficient way to design and produce rockets, a way can reduce the cost by 10x, reduce the producing duration by 10x. 3d priting technology is a such a method.

## Advantags of 3d metal printing

- Born for manufactoruing complex and intricate part, it can reduce total number of parts for intricate design as far as 3 magnitude comparing to traditinal CNC way or metal pouring way.
- Rapid prototyping and iteration for rocket engineering
- Customization design
